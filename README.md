# Advanced Agriculture Data Table Web App

This project is an advanced data table web app built using Vite+React+Typescript. The application processes and visualizes Indian agriculture data from a JSON file, providing users with two tables: one aggregating crop data by year with maximum and minimum production, and the other aggregating average yield and cultivation area by crop between 1950-2020.
